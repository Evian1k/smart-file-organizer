# Smart File Organizer CLI App

## Overview

Smart File Organizer is a command-line tool that helps you declutter your folders by automatically organizing files into subfolders based on their type (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos, etc.). It tracks all file moves in a database, allowing you to view history and revert changes if needed. You can also manage directories directly from the CLI.
